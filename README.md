This week I learned about more types of strings. I learned how to replace 
words by using s.replace(...). I also learned how to find the length of 
any word or sentence and be able to list them. Mr. Gold also taught me how 
to generate a random number using the commands, import random, and
random.randint(#,#).

This week I learned about 4 types of variables. I learned about string 
variables, which are bits of text you would like to display when using the 
command python. Another variable I learned about is the integer variable, 
which are number without a decimal point. Another one is floating point
variable which is like an integer except the number has a decimal. the last 
variable I learned was the boolean variable, it is like binary where it only
uses true or false.

This week I strengthened my skills in git. I'm now able to create and edit my
repository fluently. I also learned how to add bullet points and sub bullet 
points in my repository. This was overall a good week were we went over all the 
commands,and it has made it easier for me to program.
