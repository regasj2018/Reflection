# Reflection 2
## 2/2/2018
This week I strengthened my skills in git. I'm now able to create and edit my
repository fluently. I also learned how to add bullet points and sub bullet 
points in my repository. This was overall a good week were we went over all the 
commands,and it has made it easier for me to program.
