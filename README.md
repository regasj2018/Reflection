This week I learned about 4 types of variables. I learned about string 
variables, which are bits of text you would like to display when using the 
command python. Another variable I learned about is the integer variable, 
which are number without a decimal point. Another one is floating point
variable which is like an integer except the number has a decimal. the last 
variable I learned was the boolean variable, it is like binary where it only
uses true or false.

This week I strengthened my skills in git. I'm now able to create and edit my
repository fluently. I also learned how to add bullet points and sub bullet 
points in my repository. This was overall a good week were we went over all the 
commands,and it has made it easier for me to program.
