This week I learned how to generate a specific amount of lines of text using
loops. I also learned how to make calculators using input and combining 
strings. I successfully completed part 1 of the homework and some of part 2.
I also learned how to make certain variables to do something completely random
in a range of my choosing.

This week I learned about 4 types of variables. I learned about string 
variables, which are bits of text you would like to display when using the 
command python. Another variable I learned about is the integer variable, 
which are number without a decimal point. Another one is floating point
variable which is like an integer except the number has a decimal. the last 
variable I learned was the boolean variable, it is like binary where it only
uses true or false.
